## Lua Libraries

**These libraries are base Lua libraries, most likely with some enhancements or in some cases, certain functions missing**.

### math library

*This library is for the most part, basically the library described in http://lua-users.org/wiki/MathLibraryTutorial, but with functions added to it.*

The additional functions are:

#### math.clamp

*Parameters: **number** value, **number** min, **number** max*

*Returns: **number** clampedValue*

This function clamps *value* between *min* and *max* and then returns it.

#### math.round

*Parameters: **number** value*

*Returns: **number** roundedValue*

This function rounds a number, then returns it.
